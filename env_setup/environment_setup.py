    Summary:
        This function performs the essential initialization tasks for setting up the ArcGIS Pro
        environment and creating a predefined directory structure for the project.

    Details:
        - Initializes the ArcGIS environment setup by configuring workspace, output coordinate system (EPSG:25833),
          xy tolerance (0.02 meters), and xy resolution (0.01 meters), parallel processing factor and set the overwrite output flag to True.
        - Sets up the project directory structure, including creating geodatabases and layer files directories.

    Summary:
        Sets up the ArcGIS Pro environment with specified workspace and spatial reference.

    Details:
        - Checks if setup has already been done globally to avoid duplication.
        - Sets `arcpy.env.overwriteOutput` to True, ensuring existing files can be overwritten.
        - Configures `arcpy.env.workspace` with the specified workspace path.
        - Sets the output coordinate system to the specified spatial reference (EPSG code).
        - Establishes `arcpy.env.XYTolerance` and `arcpy.env.XYResolution` for geometric precision.
        - Adjusts `arcpy.env.parallelProcessingFactor` according to CPU percentage configured, optimizing performance.
